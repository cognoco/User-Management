# Known Testing Issues and Debugging History

This document tracks known issues with the test suite in `project/` and summarizes previous debugging efforts.

## Current Known Issues (As of Migration Completion)

1.  **Empty Test Suite:**
    *   **File:** `src/components/auth/__tests__/AuthComponent.example.test.tsx`
    *   **Suite:** `AuthTestComponent with helper function`
    *   **Error:** `No test found in suite AuthTestComponent with helper function`
    *   **Action:** This test suite needs actual test cases (`it(...)` blocks) added or the `describe` block should be removed if it's obsolete.

2.  **Test Timeouts:**
    *   **File:** `src/components/auth/__tests__/RegistrationForm.test.tsx`
    *   **Tests:** 
        *   `shows success message and redirects on successful registration`
        *   `shows API error message when registration fails`
    *   **Error:** `Test timed out in 15000ms` (or `30000ms` when increased).
    *   **Cause Analysis:** See detailed section below.
    *   **Recommendation:** See detailed section below.

3.  **React Warning (Refs):**
    *   **File:** `src/components/auth/__tests__/LoginForm.test.tsx`
    *   **Warning:** `Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail... Check the render method of LoginForm.`
    *   **Cause:** Although mocks for `Input`, `Textarea`, and `SelectTrigger` were updated with `React.forwardRef`, this specific warning persists for `LoginForm`. It might be related to the mocked `form` element itself, another UI component mock used only in this test, or how the test interacts with the mocked `react-hook-form`.
    *   **Action:** Needs further investigation within `LoginForm.test.tsx` to pinpoint the specific element/mock receiving an unhandled ref.

4.  **Radix UI `act(...)` Warnings:**
    *   **Files:** Tests involving Radix UI components like `Popover` (e.g., `SocialSharingComponent.test.tsx`).
    *   **Warning:** `Warning: An update to [Presence/PopperContent/FocusScope/etc.] inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).`
    *   **Cause:** These warnings often stem from internal state updates within the Radix UI components related to animations, portal mounting, or focus management that occur asynchronously after the initial test interaction.
    *   **Action:** Currently, these warnings do not seem to cause test failures or instability. Monitor if tests become flaky. If necessary, wrapping interactions that open/close Radix components in `act(async () => { ... })` might help, but can also make tests more complex. See Radix UI documentation or testing recipes for potential best practices.

## RegistrationForm Timeouts - Investigation & Recommendation

### Problem Summary

The two tests mentioned above consistently time out because the `await screen.findByText(...)` call fails to find the expected success or error message within the time limit. Log statements confirm that the component's `onSubmit` handler runs, the mocked `registerUser` action resolves as expected (success or failure), and the component calls the appropriate state setter (`setApiSuccess` or `setApiError`). However, the subsequent UI update (rendering the `Alert` component with the message) does not appear to happen reliably or quickly enough in the test environment for `findByText` to detect it.

### Likely Cause

The most likely cause is interference from the **heavy mocking of the `react-hook-form` (`useForm`) hook** within `RegistrationForm.test.tsx`. By completely mocking `useForm` and its returned functions (`handleSubmit`, `register`, `formState`, etc.) and directly calling the extracted `onSubmitFn`, the test bypasses the natural interaction flow managed by `react-hook-form`. This artificial setup seems to disrupt React's state update and re-rendering cycle within the Vitest/JSDOM environment, preventing the conditionally rendered `Alert` from appearing reliably after the state update.

### Current Recommendation

Increasing the test timeout did not resolve the issue. The recommended approach is to **refactor the two failing tests to remove the mocking of `useForm`**. Instead, the tests should:

1.  Render the `RegistrationForm` using the *real* `useForm` hook.
2.  Use `@testing-library/user-event` to simulate user actions:
    *   `userEvent.type()` to fill required inputs (email, password, name, etc.).
    *   `userEvent.click()` to check the "Accept Terms" checkbox.
    *   `userEvent.click()` to click the actual submit button.
3.  Continue to mock the `useAuthStore`'s `register` action to control the API response (success/failure).
4.  Use `await screen.findByText(...)` to assert that the correct success or error message appears in the UI after the simulated submission.

This approach tests the component's behavior more realistically and avoids the problems associated with deep hook mocking.

## RegistrationForm Integration Test Debugging Attempts (2024-06)

### Context
After migration to the new root and refactoring to use real hooks and user-event, the RegistrationForm integration tests (in `src/components/auth/__tests__/RegistrationForm.integration.test.tsx`) still fail for all dynamic user flows (validation, navigation, error display), despite static rendering tests passing.

### Strategies Attempted and Results

1. **Simulating User Events with userEvent**
   - Used `userEvent.type`, `userEvent.clear`, `userEvent.tab`, and `userEvent.click` to simulate real user input and navigation.
   - **Result:** No validation errors or DOM changes appeared after user events. Only static rendering test passed.

2. **Adding Deep Debug Logs and screen.debug()**
   - Inserted `screen.debug()` and `console.log` after each user event to inspect DOM and input values.
   - **Result:** No output appeared in the test logs, suggesting either logs are suppressed or the test is hanging before reaching these lines.

3. **Using fireEvent as Fallback**
   - Added `fireEvent.blur` and `fireEvent.change` after clearing each input to try to trigger validation manually.
   - **Result:** No change in test outcome; validation errors still did not appear.

4. **Timers: Fake vs Real**
   - The test file used `vi.useFakeTimers()`. Suspected that React Hook Form or UI libraries might require real timers for async validation/effects.
   - **Action:** Next step is to try switching to `vi.useRealTimers()` and rerun tests.

5. **Minimal Manual Test**
   - Proposed creating a minimal test that only types into one input and logs the value and DOM.
   - **Result:** Not yet attempted, but recommended as next step if timer change does not resolve the issue.

6. **Checking for Console Output Suppression**
   - Advised running Vitest with `--reporter=verbose` and adding a top-level `console.log` to check if logs are being suppressed.
   - **Result:** Not yet confirmed if logs are visible.

### Summary
- All dynamic tests time out, indicating that user events are not triggering state changes or validation in the form.
- The issue is likely due to a mismatch between Testing Library, JSDOM, and React Hook Form event handling, or possibly timer configuration.
- Next steps: Try real timers, confirm log visibility, and attempt a minimal manual test to isolate the problem.

## Debugging History & Lessons Learned (from previous docs)

*   **`vi.mock` Hoisting:** Early issues were encountered due to Vitest hoisting `vi.mock` calls above variable declarations needed within the mock factory. Solved by ensuring mock function variables are defined before the `vi.mock` call that uses them, or using the `vi.mock` factory function correctly.
*   **Simulating Form Submission:** Attempts to use `fireEvent.click` on the submit button often failed because the heavy mocking of `react-hook-form` didn't accurately reflect the form's `isValid` state, leaving the button disabled. Directly using `fireEvent.submit` on the form element also proved unreliable.
*   **Bypassing Submission:** The strategy of extracting the `onSubmit` function from the mocked `handleSubmit` and calling it directly was implemented to bypass the validation/disabled button issues. However, this led to the current timeout problems, likely because it disconnects the submission logic from React's rendering cycle in the mocked environment.
*   **Mocking Strategy:** Emphasized the importance of mocking external dependencies (UI components, hooks, APIs) and resetting mocks/state between tests.
*   **Selectors:** Recommended using specific selectors (e.g., regex with `^`) to avoid ambiguity.

### React Hook Form Validation Testing (2024-03-21)

A significant issue was resolved in the `RegistrationForm` validation tests. The key findings were:

1. **Validation Mode Understanding:**
   - The form was configured with `mode: 'onChange'` but tests were trying to trigger validation only on submit
   - Solution: Trigger validation by simulating actual user input (type and clear) for each field

2. **Test Structure:**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Previous approach (unreliable)
   await user.click(submitButton);
   expect(screen.getByText('error')).toBeInTheDocument();

   // ✅ New approach (reliable)
   // 1. Trigger validation per field
   await user.type(input, 'a');
   await user.clear(input);
   
   // 2. Submit form to ensure all validations
   await user.click(submitButton);
   
   // 3. Check both messages and states
   await waitFor(() => {
     expect(screen.getByText('error')).toBeInTheDocument();
     expect(input).toHaveAttribute('aria-invalid', 'true');
   });
   ```

3. **Key Lessons:**
   - Match test behavior to actual form configuration (validation mode)
   - Simulate real user interactions instead of direct state manipulation
   - Check both error messages and input states
   - Use `waitFor` to handle state updates reliably

This approach resolved the validation test issues without needing to modify the component's validation mode or resort to heavy mocking of React Hook Form internals.

This history highlights the difficulties of testing components that rely heavily on complex external hooks like `react-hook-form` when using extensive mocking. Reducing mocking and testing closer to actual user interaction (`userEvent`) is often more robust.

## SearchPage Integration Test Issues (Resolved)

### Problem Summary

Integration tests for the `SearchPage` component (`src/tests/integration/search-filter-flow.test.tsx`) initially suffered from several issues:

1.  **Missing Component:** The test file referenced a non-existent `SearchPage` component.
2.  **Inconsistent UI Updates:** After creating the component and implementing basic Supabase fetching, tests involving user input (typing in the search box, selecting date ranges, clicking the reset button) failed. Assertions checking the rendered list of items or UI messages (like "No results found") did not pass consistently, often reflecting a stale state despite mocked Supabase calls resolving correctly.

### Cause Analysis

*   **Missing Component:** Simple omission during development.
*   **Inconsistent UI Updates:** This was traced to timing issues between asynchronous operations (the `useEffect` hook fetching data after state changes) and the test assertions. Rapid state changes triggered by user input (especially typing character by character) caused the `useEffect` hook to fire frequently. The test's `waitFor` calls, even with increased timeouts and ticks, struggled to reliably catch the component's final rendered state after these rapid, async updates.

### Resolution Steps

1.  **Component Creation:** Created the basic `SearchPage` component structure (`src/components/search/SearchPage.tsx`) based on test requirements.
2.  **Implemented Fetching:** Replaced placeholder logic in `SearchPage` with actual Supabase data fetching logic within the `useEffect` hook, triggered by changes in filter states.
3.  **Debounced Search Input:** Introduced a `useDebounce` hook (`src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`) and applied it to the `searchTerm` state in `SearchPage`. This was a crucial step, preventing the `useEffect` (and subsequent Supabase query) from running on every keystroke. Instead, it only runs after the user pauses typing, significantly reducing the frequency of async updates.
4.  **Refined Mocking Strategy:** Adjusted the mock logic within `search-filter-flow.test.tsx`:
    *   **Improved `beforeEach` Cleanup:** Ensured the Supabase query builder mock (`itemsBuilder.then`) was fully reset (`mockRestore()`) and the default implementation re-applied before each test, guaranteeing a consistent starting state for the initial data load.
    *   **Accurate Mocking Sequence:** Updated tests involving multiple user actions (e.g., click filter + type search) to mock the `.then` method for *each* expected asynchronous fetch triggered by the component's `useEffect` hook (including the one after the debounce delay).
    *   **Adjusted Assertions:** Ensured assertions correctly checked the final UI state *and* verified that the expected filters (`.ilike`, `.in`, etc.) were called on the mock during the *appropriate* fetch sequence.

### Key Lessons

*   **Debounce User Input:** For components involving search or filtering triggered by user typing, debouncing the input before triggering expensive operations (like API calls) is essential for both performance and test stability.
*   **Align Mocks with Component Behavior:** When testing components with asynchronous operations triggered by state changes, ensure the test mocks accurately reflect the *number* and *sequence* of those async calls (e.g., multiple `.then` mocks if `useEffect` runs multiple times).
*   **Robust Cleanup:** Use `mockRestore()` in `beforeEach` or `afterEach` for critical mocks (like promise resolutions) to prevent state leakage between tests, in addition to clearing call counts (`mockClearAllMocks`, `mockClear`). 

## SocialSharingComponent Integration Test Issues (Resolved)

### Problem Summary

Integration tests for the `SocialSharingComponent` (`src/tests/integration/social-sharing-flow.test.tsx`) went through several iterations:

1.  **Initial Failure (Component Refactor Mismatch):** After refactoring the component to accept `itemData` via props instead of fetching internally via `itemId`, the tests failed because they were still passing `itemId` and relied on (now removed) internal fetching mocks.
2.  **Mock Chaining Error:** Once the test was updated to pass `itemData`, it failed with `TypeError: ...eq is not a function`. This was because the component used a `select().eq().single()` chain, but the Supabase mock in the test only mocked `.select()` to return a directly resolvable promise.
3.  **Popover Timing Issues:** Tests failed to find elements (like the item title) inside the `PopoverContent` because assertions ran *before* the user interaction (clicking the trigger) opened the popover.
4.  **Assertion Specificity:** A test failed because an assertion checking the `mailto:` body was too strict, expecting exact equality instead of checking if the body *contained* the expected URL.

### Resolution Steps

1.  **Synced Test with Refactor:** Updated the test file to remove internal fetching mocks (Supabase client mocks) and pass the required `itemData` prop directly to the component during rendering.
2.  **Corrected Mock Chain:** Refined the Supabase mock (in tests where it was needed before the refactor, and as a general example) to correctly mock each method in the chain (`.from().select().eq().single()`), ensuring the final method (`.single()`) resolved the promise.
3.  **Adjusted Test Flow for Popover:** Modified the test interaction sequence:
    *   Render the component.
    *   Wait for the `PopoverTrigger` button to be present/enabled.
    *   Simulate `userEvent.click` on the trigger.
    *   Use `waitFor` to wait for specific elements *inside* the `PopoverContent` to appear before proceeding with assertions.
4.  **Refined Assertion:** Changed the `mailto:` body assertion from checking exact equality (`body=URL`) to using `.toContain(URL)` to allow for introductory text in the email body.

### Key Lessons

*   **Sync Tests with Refactors:** When component props or internal logic (especially data fetching) are refactored, the corresponding tests *must* be updated immediately to reflect these changes.
*   **Accurate Mocking of Chains:** Ensure mocks for chained methods accurately reflect the methods called by the component code.
*   **Testing Interactive UI (Popovers/Modals):** Follow the pattern: Wait for Trigger -> Interact with Trigger -> Wait for Content.
*   **Assertion Precision:** Use appropriate assertion methods (`toContain` vs. exact equality) based on the expected output.

## Known Testing Issues

This document tracks persistent or significant issues encountered during testing.

### 1. Radix UI Component Interactions in JSDOM/Happy-DOM

- **Issue:** Components using Radix UI primitives (like `Select`, `DropdownMenu`) that rely on Pointer Events (`hasPointerCapture`, `releasePointerCapture`) cannot be reliably interacted with using `@testing-library/user-event` (`click`, `keyboard`) in either `jsdom` or `happy-dom` environments (as provided by Vitest).
- **Symptoms:**
    - Errors like `TypeError: target.hasPointerCapture is not a function`.
    - Failure to open dropdowns/menus when simulating clicks or key presses on trigger elements.
    - Inability to find dropdown content (`role="option"`, `role="menuitem"`) after interaction attempts.
- **Attempts:**
    - Mocking/polyfilling `PointerEvent`, `hasPointerCapture`, `releasePointerCapture`, `scrollIntoView` in `setup.ts` (various strategies tried).
    - Switching test environment from `jsdom` to `happy-dom`.
    - Using keyboard events (`user.keyboard('{ArrowDown}')`) instead of clicks.
    - Targeting hidden native elements (only applicable if the component renders one).
- **Current Status:** Unresolved environment limitation.
- **Workaround:** For tests needing to verify logic dependent on a Radix component's value (like testing form submission), consider:
    - Skipping the UI interaction part of the test (`it.skip(...)`) and documenting the limitation.
    - If absolutely necessary and possible, find alternative ways to set the underlying state managed by the component (e.g., calling a state setter directly, using `userEvent.selectOptions` on a *hidden* native `<select>` *if* one exists).
- **Example:** The `submits form with valid data` test for `InviteMemberForm` is currently skipped due to this issue.

### 2. Unhandled Promise Rejections in Async Handlers

- **Issue:** Asynchronous event handlers (e.g., `onSubmit` in forms) that `await` potentially failing operations (API calls, store actions) without wrapping the `await` in a `try...catch` block can lead to unhandled promise rejections during tests.
- **Symptoms:**
    - Test runners (like Vitest) report `[Unhandled Rejection]` errors, even if the test itself passes based on UI state assertions.
    - Instability in test runs.
- **Cause:** When the mocked async operation rejects (e.g., using `mockRejectedValueOnce` or `mockImplementation(() => Promise.reject(...))`), the error propagates out of the `async` handler because there's no `catch` block. The test runner flags this as unhandled.
- **Solution:** Ensure all `async` functions that contain `await` calls for operations that might fail are wrapped in appropriate `try...catch` blocks within the component/hook code.
    ```typescript
    const onSubmit = async (data) => {
      setIsLoading(true);
      try {
        await potentiallyFailingAsyncOperation(data);
        // Handle success
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Operation failed:", error);
        // TODO: Implement user-facing error feedback (e.g., toast)
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
    };
    ```
- **Resolution:** Applied this pattern to several `onSubmit` handlers across the codebase (e.g., in `InviteMemberForm`, `ProfileForm`, `ForgotPasswordForm`, `LoginForm`, `CorporateProfileSection`). This resolved the associated unhandled rejection warnings in tests like `InviteMemberForm.test.tsx`'s `handles submission errors` test.

## Type Drift: ProfileForm Component

- **File:** `src/components/profile/ProfileForm.tsx`
- **Issue:** The component expects flat fields on the profile object (e.g., `gender`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `postal_code`, `phone_number`, `is_public`, etc.), but the actual type (from backend/types) may use nested objects (e.g., `address: { city, state, ... }`), camelCase (e.g., `phoneNumber`), or omit some fields.
- **Symptoms:** Linter/type errors, especially after updating error handling or form logic.
- **Action Needed:**
  - Review the profile type/interface from the backend/types.
  - Update the component to destructure and use the correct fields (including nested fields if needed).
  - Update form field names and default values to match the type.
  - Update any tests that rely on the old field structure.
- **Reference:** See linter errors in ProfileForm.tsx for specific fields that are mismatched.

## RegistrationForm Provider/Context Rendering Issue (2024-06)

### Summary
- RegistrationForm tests in the main test file (`RegistrationForm.test.tsx`) fail to render the form when using the provider/context, resulting in an empty DOM and missing debug logs.
- The same provider/context and config work perfectly in a minimal integration test file, even when all relevant mocks are applied.

### Investigation Steps
1. **Started with a minimal integration test:**
   - RegistrationForm rendered with UserManagementProvider and ThemeProvider, no mocks: **works**.
2. **Added mocks one by one:**
   - ResizeObserver mock: **works**
   - next/navigation mock: **works**
   - @/components/ui/alert mock: **works**
   - lucide-react mock: **works**
   - @/lib/stores/auth.store mock: **works**
3. **Result:**
   - All mocks together do **not** break RegistrationForm rendering in the integration test context.
   - All debug logs and DOM output are as expected.

### Implications
- The issue in the main test file is **not** due to any single mock or the combination of mocks.
- The problem is likely due to **import order, test file structure, or test pollution** in the main test file.
- In the integration test, all mocks are declared before any imports from React, Testing Library, or components, which may be critical.

### Next Steps for Debugging
- Refactor the main test file to move all mocks to the very top, before any imports.
- Start with only the minimal provider render test; reintroduce other tests one by one.
- Ensure no test pollution or state leakage between tests.
- Document any further findings or fixes here.

## [BUG] RegistrationForm Not Rendering in Provider-Based Tests (2024-06-09)

### Symptoms
- All provider-based tests for RegistrationForm fail with errors like:
  - `Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="email-input"]`
  - DOM output is always `<body><div />` (i.e., nothing rendered)
- ISOLATION tests (no provider/context) pass and the form renders.
- No `[PROVIDER_DEBUG]` logs appear in the test output, indicating the provider is not being called or its logs are not visible.
- No environment errors (e.g., `window.matchMedia` is fixed).

### Diagnostics Performed
- Verified that all import paths for `UserManagementProvider` and `useUserManagement` are correct and consistent between the app and test files.
- Searched for and confirmed there are no active mocks for the provider or hook in test files or global setup.
- Added debug logs to the test file and provider to confirm execution order and context mounting.
- Confirmed that the test file and `renderWithProvider` are being executed (logs appear), but the provider and form are not rendering (no provider debug logs, empty DOM).
- Ruled out issues with test environment setup, global mocks, and import path mismatches.

### Why It Is Failing
- The provider is being mounted in the test, but the form is not rendering at all. The absence of provider debug logs suggests the provider is not being called, or the context is not propagating as expected.
- This may be due to a subtle issue with module duplication, test isolation, or a React context mismatch that is not visible in the current test setup.

### Next Steps
- Consider further isolating the provider/context logic in a minimal test to confirm propagation.
- Review for any indirect or legacy mocks, or test setup issues that could affect context propagation.
- Document this issue for future debugging and to avoid duplicate efforts.

### Status
- **Open**. All standard diagnostics have been performed; issue persists. Further investigation needed into context propagation and test environment.

## [BUG] DomainBasedOrgMatching.test.tsx - Persistent Test Failures (2024-06-09)

### Issues
- **Multiple elements with role="alert"**: Both form-level and persistent info alerts are present. Some tests expect only one alert, leading to ambiguous queries and failures.
- **Button disabled/loading state not reflected in DOM**: The mock Button and form state do not always synchronize, so the button may not appear disabled in the DOM even when the mock state is set. This causes assertions like `expect(addButton).toBeDisabled()` to fail.
- **Async assertions timing out**: Some assertions (e.g., for `mockApiPost` calls) time out because the form submission logic or mock state updates do not propagate as expected in the test environment.

### Attempted Solutions
- Updated alert queries to use `getAllByRole('alert')` and filter by text, or use `getByTestId` for form-level errors.
- Patched the Button mock to use `mockFormState.isSubmitting` and `isLoading` for its `disabled` prop.
- Moved assertions for loading state and API calls inside `waitFor` blocks.

### Why It Is Failing
- The test environment's mock form and button do not always synchronize state changes with the DOM as a real React form would. This causes the button to not appear disabled in the DOM even when the mock state is set, and async state changes may not propagate as expected.
- Multiple alerts in the DOM make it hard to assert on a single error or success message without more specific queries.
- The test relies on a complex mock of react-hook-form and form context, which can diverge from real component behavior, especially for async state and side effects.

### Next Steps
- Consider refactoring the test to use less mocking and more real form logic, or add more specific test IDs to alerts and buttons to make queries unambiguous.
- Document these limitations and the need for more robust integration tests that use the real form library where possible.

### Status
- **Open**. Partial workarounds in place, but some tests remain flaky or fail due to the above issues.

## [RESOLVED] RegistrationForm Integration Test Failures (2024-06)

### Root Cause
- The main reason for persistent failures in RegistrationForm integration tests was the use of **fake timers** (`vi.useFakeTimers()`), which broke React Hook Form's async validation and UI effects. This prevented validation errors, success messages, and navigation from appearing in the DOM during tests.
- Additional issues were caused by **test pollution** and **state leakage** between tests, especially when running multiple tests together without proper resets.

### Solution & Approach
- **Switched to real timers**: Replaced `vi.useFakeTimers()` with `vi.useRealTimers()` at the top of the test file. This allowed React Hook Form and UI libraries to process async effects and validation as they do in the browser.
- **Isolated tests**: Used `.only` to run each test in isolation, confirming that each test passes on its own and that failures were due to environment/test pollution, not app bugs.
- **Ensured proper mock and state resets**: Used `beforeEach` to reset all mocks and store state before every test, reducing state leakage.
- **Removed all `.only` and `.skip`**: Enabled all tests to run as a group, confirming that most now pass together.

### Lessons Learned
- **Never use fake timers with React Hook Form or async UI libraries** in integration tests. Always use real timers unless you have a specific, controlled use case.
- **Reset all mocks and state in `beforeEach`** to prevent leakage between tests.
- **Test in isolation first** to confirm app logic, then run tests together to check for pollution.
- **Document this pattern and apply it to other test files** to avoid similar issues elsewhere in the codebase.

### Action Items
- Update all other integration test files to use real timers and proper mock resets.
- Add a note to the testing guidelines: "Do not use fake timers with React Hook Form or async UI libraries."
- If a test fails only when run with others, investigate for state leakage or test pollution.

## [RESOLVED] RegistrationForm: Error Message Clearing Test (2024-06)

### Problem
- The test 'clears error messages when form input changes' was failing: after simulating a user submitting an empty form or blurring an empty email field, no validation error appeared, and the test could not find the expected error message in the DOM.

### Investigation & Method
- Added debug output (`screen.debug()`, input value, and `aria-invalid` state) after each user interaction to inspect the DOM and input state.
- Confirmed that the form's validation mode was set to `'onChange'` (the default for our RegistrationForm).
- Realized that, with `'onChange'` mode, validation errors only appear after the user changes the value of a field, not just on blur or submit.
- Updated the test to:
  1. Type an invalid email (e.g., 'a') and blur to trigger validation.
  2. Wait for the error message to appear.
  3. Clear the input and type a valid email to clear the error.
  4. Wait for the error message to disappear.
- This approach matches the real user experience and the form's validation mode.

### Outcome
- The test now passes, and all other integration tests for RegistrationForm pass as well.
- The debug output confirmed that validation and error-clearing logic work as intended when the test simulates a real user flow.

### Lessons Learned
- **Always align test steps with the form's validation mode** (e.g., 'onChange', 'onBlur', 'onSubmit').
- **Use debug output** to inspect the DOM and input state at each step when diagnosing test failures.
- **Simulate real user flows**: type invalid data, blur to trigger validation, then type valid data to clear errors.
- **Apply this pattern to similar tests** for other forms/components using React Hook Form or similar libraries.

## Top Priority Troubleshooting Step

**If a test involving a component and a store spy/mock is failing:**

- **FIRST check that the component is actually using the store (not calling a service or API directly), and that the import path matches the path being mocked in the test.**
    - If the component calls a service (e.g., Supabase) directly, the store mock/spy will never be called.
    - If the import path in the component does not match the path being mocked in the test, the mock/spy will not be applied.
    - Fixing this is required before any other test debugging will be effective.

## User Auth Flow Integration Test Debugging (user-auth-flow.test.tsx - [Current Date])

Debugging the `User can sign up, login, and update profile` test revealed several issues related to mocking external dependencies, particularly Zustand stores and Supabase client calls.

### Issue 1: Mock Call Tracking Discrepancy (Zustand Store)

- **Problem:** Assertions like `expect(mockLogin).toHaveBeenCalled()` failed, even when debug logs confirmed the mocked `login` function's implementation *was* being executed within the component.
- **Cause:** Initial mocking approaches using `vi.mock` and accessing the mock function via the hook (`useAuthStore().login`) within the test scope led to a state where the test held a reference to a different mock instance/spy than the one the component received and executed. Attempts using `vi.spyOn` also failed due to complexities in targeting the correct store instance method when only the hook is exported.
- **Resolution / Recommended Pattern:** The most stable solution involved:
    1.  Using `vi.mock` for the store module (`@/lib/stores/auth.store`).
    2.  Defining a plain JavaScript object (`mockAuthStoreActions` in the test file) containing all the necessary mock functions (`login: vi.fn(...)`, `register: vi.fn(...)`, etc.). This object should be defined *outside* the `vi.mock` factory function.
    3.  Inside the `vi.mock` factory, returning an object where the store hook (`useAuthStore`) is mocked to simply return the pre-defined `mockAuthStoreActions` object: `vi.mock('@/lib/stores/auth.store', () => ({ useAuthStore: vi.fn(() => mockAuthStoreActions) }));`
    4.  In the test file, **importing the `mockAuthStoreActions` object directly** and using its functions (`mockAuthStoreActions.login`, `mockAuthStoreActions.register`) for assertions.
- **Lesson:** This pattern ensures both the component (via the mocked hook) and the test assertions operate on the exact same mock function instances, avoiding tracking discrepancies.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Supabase Mock Chaining Override

- **Problem:** After resolving the login mock issue, the test failed during profile update with `TypeError: supabase.from(...).select(...).eq is not a function`.
- **Cause:** The test attempted to override the mock for a chained Supabase call (`select().eq().single()`) incorrectly by applying `.mockResolvedValueOnce` to the *end* of the chain.
- **Resolution / Recommended Pattern:**
    1.  The central Supabase mock (`src/tests/__mocks__/supabase.tsx`) should correctly mock the chainable methods (e.g., `select`, `eq`) to return `self`.
    2.  In the specific test requiring an override, get the query builder instance: `const profileQueryBuilder = supabase.from('profiles');`
    3.  Mock the **terminal method** (e.g., `.single()`) on *that specific instance* using `.mockResolvedValueOnce()` or similar: `((profileQueryBuilder as any).single as any).mockResolvedValueOnce({ data: ..., error: null });`. Using `as any` might be necessary to bypass TypeScript issues with mock types.
- **Lesson:** Override mocks for chained calls by targeting the terminal method on the specific query builder instance used in that part of the test.

### Issue 3: Mismatched UI Selectors

- **Problem:** The test failed to find elements using `getByLabelText` or `getByRole` because the labels or button text used in the test did not exactly match what the `ProfileEditor` component rendered.
- **Resolution:** Updated the selectors in the test (`/full name/i` to `/name/i`, `/update profile/i` to `/save profile/i`) after inspecting the actual DOM output from the failing test.
- **Lesson:** Always verify UI selectors against the current component structure, especially after refactoring or if tests fail to find elements. Using `screen.debug()` during debugging is helpful.

### Issue 4: Incorrect Supabase Update Payload Assertion ([Date Resolved])

- **Resolution:** This was resolved by realizing the `ProfileEditor` calls the `useProfileStore().updateProfile` function, not `supabase.from(...).upsert` directly. The assertion was updated to check the mock for `updateProfile` instead.

### Issue 5: Silent Form Validation Failures Blocking Submission ([Date Resolved])

- **Problem:** Test assertions fail because expected mock functions (e.g., inside an `onSubmit` handler) are not called, despite the submit button being clicked.
- **Symptoms:** Debug logs might show the `user.click` event, but not subsequent logs from within the `onSubmit`. Inspecting the DOM (`screen.debug()`) *before* the click reveals validation error messages associated with specific form fields.
- **Cause:** `react-hook-form` (or similar libraries) runs validation *before* executing the `onSubmit` handler passed to `handleSubmit`. If any field fails validation (even if it's not the field being actively changed by the test user), `onSubmit` will not be called. This can happen if fields lack valid default values (e.g., due to type mismatches between component/store state) or if the test doesn't populate them sufficiently.
- **Example:** In `user-auth-flow.test.tsx`, the `ProfileEditor`'s email field defaulted to `''` (because the `Profile` type has no email, and the component didn't pull it from auth state correctly in the test setup), which failed the internal Zod email validation, preventing `onSubmit` and the `updateProfile` mock call.
- **Resolution / Lesson:** When testing form submissions, always ensure *all* fields required by the component's validation schema have valid values *before* simulating the submit action (`user.click`). Populate necessary fields using `user.type` etc., even if they aren't the primary focus of the specific update being tested. Check the DOM for validation errors if `onSubmit` appears not to be running.

## Validation Error Assertion Method (RegistrationForm)

- **Files:**
    - Isolated test: `src/tests/integration/form-validation-errors-isolated.test.tsx`
    - Original test suite: `src/components/auth/__tests__/RegistrationForm.integration.test.tsx` (Potentially similar issues)
- **Issue:** An isolated test (`form-validation-errors-isolated.test.tsx`) designed to check the simultaneous appearance of all required field validation errors in the `RegistrationForm` was failing.
- **Symptoms:**
    - Test failed with `expected null not to be null` on the assertion `expect(emailInput.getAttribute('aria-describedby')).not.toBeNull();`.
    - `screen.debug()` output confirmed that validation error messages (`<p>` tags) *were* being rendered below the input fields after submitting an invalid form.
- **Cause:** The test assertion incorrectly assumed that the component would link input fields to their corresponding error messages using the `aria-describedby` attribute. The component implementation, however, simply rendered the error messages as sibling elements without establishing this explicit ARIA relationship.
- **Resolution:**
    - Modified the assertions in `form-validation-errors-isolated.test.tsx`.
    - Removed the checks for the `aria-describedby` attribute.
    - Replaced them with assertions using `screen.getByText(/.../i)` to directly verify the presence of the specific error message text as observed in the `screen.debug()` output.
- **Key Lesson:** Test assertions should verify the actual rendered output and user-perceptible behavior. Relying on specific implementation details (like ARIA attributes) can make tests brittle if the implementation changes or doesn't follow the assumed pattern, even if the visual outcome for the user is correct. 

## [RESOLVED] RegistrationForm Validation Tests (`form-validation-errors.test.tsx`)

- **File:** `src/tests/integration/form-validation-errors.test.tsx`
- **Initial State:** Multiple tests failing after setup changes (switching to AuthStore mock, removing Supabase mock). Failures included timeouts, inability to find elements, and incorrect assertions.
- **Debugging Journey & Issues:**
    1.  **Mocking Context (`useUserManagement`):** The most persistent issue was the `Validates complex form...` test failing because the `RegistrationForm` component received the default context (`corporateUsers.enabled: false`) instead of the mocked value (`enabled: true`), preventing conditional UI (user type radio buttons) from rendering.
        *   Tried mocking the hook (`useUserManagement`) via `vi.mock` in the test file - led to hoisting/`ReferenceError` issues.
        *   Tried a manual mock file (`__mocks__/UserManagementProvider.tsx`) for the hook and provider - Vitest didn't automatically apply it consistently, component still received default context.
        *   Tried forcing the manual mock via `vi.doMock` - still resulted in the component receiving the default context.
        *   Attempts to make the manual mock provider more robust failed due to inability to import the actual `UserManagementContext` object.
    2.  **Assertion Failures:** Several tests failed due to:
        *   Ambiguous selectors (e.g., `/password/i` matching multiple fields).
        *   Assertions checking for UI elements/text/classes that weren't actually rendered (e.g., `/try using a phrase.../` suggestion, `/password strength: weak/` indicator, `.valid-input` class).
        *   Incorrect expected error messages in assertions (e.g., expecting "Email is required" when format validation produced "Please enter a valid email address").
    3.  **Interaction Failures:** Tests attempting to trigger validation by clicking the submit button on an empty/invalid form failed because the button was disabled by React Hook Form's validation, preventing the click event from triggering validation checks or `onSubmit`.
    4.  **Focus Management:** Keyboard navigation test using `user.tab()` and checking `document.activeElement` was unreliable in JSDOM.
    5.  **Infinite Loop Scare:** Adding `clearMocks: true` to `vitest.config.ts` caused an infinite loop, likely due to complex interactions with global mocks in `vitest.setup.ts`. This config change was reverted.
- **Resolution:**
    1.  **Context Mocking:** Abandoned mocking the `useUserManagement` hook. Instead, used the **actual `UserManagementProvider`** component in `render()` calls. For tests requiring non-default context values (like `Validates complex form...`), a specific `testConfig` object was defined within the test and passed directly to the provider: `<UserManagementProvider config={testConfig}>...</UserManagementProvider>`.
    2.  **Assertions:** Corrected ambiguous selectors (using `^` and `*` in regex). Removed assertions for UI elements/text that were confirmed not present via `screen.debug()`.
    3.  **Interactions:** Updated tests relying on submit clicks for validation errors. Changed them to trigger validation via user interactions (`type`, `clear`, `tab`) appropriate for the form's `'onChange'` mode.
    4.  **Focus:** Updated keyboard navigation test to use direct focus setting (`element.focus()`) and the `toHaveFocus()` matcher.
- **Key Lessons:**
    *   Mocking context providers/hooks can be very complex and brittle due to module resolution and potential interference from other mocks (global or manual). Directly passing configuration props to the real provider is often more robust and maintainable for integration tests needing specific context states.
    *   Always verify test assertions against actual component output (`screen.debug()`) rather than assumptions about implementation details (like specific text, classes, or ARIA attributes).
    *   Test interactions must align with component logic (e.g., form validation modes, disabled states). Do not assume clicking a disabled button will trigger validation.
