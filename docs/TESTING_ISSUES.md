# TESTING_ISSUES.md

## Approach Update (2024-06)

- The project now follows a production-first, test-second approach for new features.
- Test skeletons are only created in advance if a feature is high-risk or likely to cause regressions.
- This ensures that tests are always written against the real, user-facing implementation.

## Known Issues
- See previous entries for ongoing and resolved issues.
- Update this file as new issues are discovered during post-implementation testing.
