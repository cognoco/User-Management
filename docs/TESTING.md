## Recent Test Infrastructure Updates (May 2025)

- **TypeScript Configuration:**
  - Enabled `jsx: react-jsx` for modern React JSX transform.
  - Added `allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true` and ensured `esModuleInterop: true` for compatibility with default imports (e.g., React).
  - Confirmed and documented path alias support: `@/*` now maps to `src/*` via `tsconfig.json`.
- **Vite/Vitest Configuration:**
  - Installed and enabled `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin in `vitest.config.ts` to ensure path aliases work in both app and test environments.
  - Removed manual alias config in favor of plugin-based resolution.
- **Jest-DOM Matchers:**
  - Confirmed global setup of `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers in `vitest.setup.ts` for all tests.

## Recent Test Infrastructure Updates (June 2024)

- **TypeScript Configuration:**
  - Enabled `jsx: react-jsx` for modern React JSX transform.
  - Added `allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true` and ensured `esModuleInterop: true` for compatibility with default imports (e.g., React).
  - Confirmed and documented path alias support: `@/*` now maps to `src/*` via `tsconfig.json`.
- **Vite/Vitest Configuration:**
  - Installed and enabled `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin in `vitest.config.ts` to ensure path aliases work in both app and test environments.
  - Removed manual alias config in favor of plugin-based resolution.
- **Jest-DOM Matchers:**
  - Confirmed global setup of `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers in `vitest.setup.ts` for all tests.
  - No further action needed; all tests can use matchers like `toBeInTheDocument()`.

## General Test Best Practices

1. **Isolate Tests with Local Mocks**
   - Use local mock components or stores within each test (or test suite) rather than relying on global mocks or patching deep internals.
   - Prevents test pollution, ensures each test is fully in control of its dependencies, and avoids issues with module caching or import order.
   - Define mock components/functions inside the test file and only mock what you need for the specific test.

2. **Reset Modules and Mocks Before Each Test**
   - Always call `vi.resetModules()` and `vi.clearAllMocks()` in a `beforeEach` block.
   - Ensures a clean slate for every test, preventing state leakage and unexpected behavior.
   - Example:
     ```ts
     beforeEach(() => {
       vi.resetModules();
       vi.clearAllMocks();
     });
     ```

3. **Avoid Importing Modules Before Mocks Are Set**
   - Set up all mocks before importing the module under test.
   - Ensures that the module uses the mocked dependencies, not the real ones.
   - Use dynamic `await import()` after mocks are set up. Never import the component at the top of the file if you need to mock its dependencies.

4. **Use User-Centric Testing Patterns**
   - Interact with the UI as a user would (using `@testing-library/user-event`), and assert on visible output, not internal state.
   - Tests are more resilient to refactoring and better reflect real user experience.
   - Use `screen.getByRole`, `screen.getByLabelText`, etc. Avoid querying by implementation details (e.g., class names, test IDs unless necessary).

## Zod Schema & Form Field Alignment Issue (Case Study)

**Problem:**
- If a Zod schema used for form validation includes a required field (e.g., `email`) that is not actually rendered in the form, form validation will always fail, and the submit handler will never be called.
- This can cause tests to fail with errors like: `expected mock to be called, but it was never called`.

**Example:**
- In the `ProfileEditor` component, the Zod schema required an `email` field, but the form did not render an email input. As a result, the form could never be submitted, and the test for profile update always failed.

**Solution:**
- Always ensure that the Zod schema matches the fields actually rendered in the form. Remove any required fields from the schema that are not present in the UI, or make them optional if they are conditionally rendered.
- After aligning the schema and the form, the test and the user flow will work as expected.

## Backup Codes Integration & E2E Tests

### Integration Test: `src/tests/integration/backup.integration.test.tsx`
- **Covers:**
  - Display, download, copy, and regenerate backup codes in user settings
  - Verifying a valid backup code in the MFA verification form
  - Error handling for invalid backup codes
- **Tools:** React Testing Library, MSW, React Query

### E2E Test: `e2e/backup-codes.e2e.test.ts`
- **Covers:**
  - User can generate, download, and regenerate backup codes in settings
  - User can use a backup code to log in when 2FA is required
  - Error handling for invalid backup codes during login
- **Tools:** Playwright

### Notes
- Tests simulate real user actions for backup code management and recovery flows.
- Integration and E2E tests ensure both UI and backend endpoints work as intended.
- If backup code flows are extended (e.g., admin/manual recovery), tests should be updated accordingly.

## For Test Coverage Gaps and Current Status

- For the canonical list of missing tests and coverage gaps, see [`docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md`](./GAP_ANALYSIS.md).
- For the latest test run results and actionable findings, see [`docs/Testing_Findings.md`](./Testing_Findings.md).
- For ongoing and known issues, see [`docs/TESTING_ISSUES.md`](./TESTING_ISSUES.md).

## (2024-06-24) Supabase Builder Chain Mocking Pattern

- **Pattern:** When mocking Supabase's `.from(...).update(...).eq(...)` chain, always return a builder object at each step, not a promise. This prevents `eq is not a function` errors in tests.
- **Example:**
  ```js
  update: vi.fn().mockImplementation((updates) => ({
    eq: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => Promise.resolve({ data: updatedProfile, error: null }))
  }))
  ```
- **Why:** The real Supabase client returns a builder at each step, so tests must mirror this for correct behavior.
- **Reference:** See `TESTING_ISSUES.md` and `Testing_Findings.md` for more details and examples.

## (2024-06-24) React act(...) Warnings

- **Pattern:** Always wrap user events and async state updates in `await act(async () => { ... })` or `await waitFor(...)` to avoid act warnings and ensure reliable test results.
- **Reference:** See `TESTING_ISSUES.md` and `Testing_Findings.md` for more details and examples.

## Lessons Learned from SSO Test Remediation (2024-06)

- Always ensure React versions are aligned between app and test environments to avoid invalid hook call errors.
- Wire test handlers and mocks carefullyâ€”pass all necessary props and arguments through UI layers to ensure user actions trigger the correct logic.
- When asserting on error messages, use the actual user-facing message, not i18n keys or internal codes.
- For advanced test scenarios (e.g., custom scopes, callback/session logic), allow tests to set window-scoped flags or inject test-specific logic, and document this pattern for future maintainers.
