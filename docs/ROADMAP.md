# ROADMAP

## Approach Update (2024-06)

- The project now uses a production-first, test-second approach for all new features.
- Tests are written after the production code is complete, unless a feature is high-risk or likely to cause regressions.
- This ensures that tests always reflect the real, user-facing implementation.

## Completed Features
- See IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and GAP_ANALYSIS.md for details.

## Next Steps
- Continue with the next prioritized feature from the checklist, following the updated approach.
