# Accessibility Implementation Plan

This document provides a step-by-step, incremental plan for making the User Management Module accessible. It is designed for modular, plug-in systems and can be adapted as the project evolves.

---

## Why Accessibility?
- Ensures your module can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities.
- Reduces legal and business risk for any application that uses your module.
- Makes your code more robust, maintainable, and future-proof.

## Step-by-Step Accessibility Plan

### **Step 1: Establish Accessibility Baseline**
- [ ] Use semantic HTML for all UI elements (buttons, forms, headings, lists, etc.).
- [ ] Ensure every form input has a `<label>`.
- [ ] All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) are keyboard accessible.
- [ ] Add `alt` text to all images and icons.
- [ ] Avoid using color as the only means of conveying information.

### **Step 2: Pick a Core Flow or Component**
- [ ] Choose a high-priority flow (e.g., login, registration, profile update).
- [ ] Review and update it for accessibility using the baseline checklist.
- [ ] Test with keyboard only (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Esc).
- [ ] Run an automated accessibility checker (axe, Lighthouse) and fix critical issues.

### **Step 3: Document and Track Progress**
- [ ] Create a simple checklist or table to track which flows/components have been reviewed and fixed.
- [ ] Note any issues that require more complex fixes or design changes.

### **Step 4: Repeat for All Major Flows/Components**
- [ ] Move to the next most important user flow or component.
- [ ] Apply the same review and fix process.

### **Step 5: Advanced Accessibility Enhancements**
- [ ] Add ARIA roles and attributes where needed (e.g., dialogs, alerts, navigation landmarks).
- [ ] Ensure all error messages are accessible to screen readers.
- [ ] Add focus indicators and skip links for improved navigation.
- [ ] Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- [ ] Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, etc.).

### **Step 6: Automated and Manual Testing**
- [ ] Integrate automated accessibility checks (axe, Lighthouse) into your CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Add regression tests for a11y-critical flows using Testing Library a11y queries.
- [ ] Periodically conduct manual audits (keyboard, screen reader, color contrast).

### **Step 7: Documentation and Guidance for Integrators**
- [ ] Document your module's accessibility features and limitations.
- [ ] Provide guidance for host apps on maintaining accessibility when integrating your module (e.g., theming, focus management).

## Suggested Order of Flows/Components to Review
1. Login & Registration
2. Password Recovery/Reset
3. Profile Update & Settings
4. MFA/2FA Setup
5. Team/Organization Management
6. Notification Preferences
7. Data Export
8. Admin/Audit Log UI
9. Any additional user-facing flows

## Progress Tracking Table (Example)

| Flow/Component         | Baseline | Keyboard | Automated | Screen Reader | Contrast | ARIA/Advanced | Notes |
|-----------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------------:|:--------:|:-------------:|-------|
| Login                 | [ ]      | [ ]      | [ ]       | [ ]           | [ ]      | [ ]           |       |
| Registration          | [ ]      | [ ]      | [ ]       | [ ]           | [ ]      | [ ]           |       |
| Profile Update        | [ ]      | [ ]      | [ ]       | [ ]           | [ ]      | [ ]           |       |
| ...                   |          |          |           |               |          |               |       |

## Notes
- Update this plan as you make progress or discover new accessibility needs.
- Prioritize flows/components that are most critical to end users.
- Accessibility is an ongoing processâ€”regularly review and improve as your module evolves.
