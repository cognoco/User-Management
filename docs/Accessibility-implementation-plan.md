# Accessibility Documentation

This document provides a step-by-step, incremental plan for making the User Management Module accessible. It is designed for modular, plug-in systems and can be adapted as the project evolves.

---

## Why Accessibility?
- Ensures your module can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities.
- Reduces legal and business risk for any application that uses your module.
- Makes your code more robust, maintainable, and future-proof.

## Step-by-Step Accessibility Plan

### **Step 1: Establish Accessibility Baseline**
- [x] Use semantic HTML for all UI elements (buttons, forms, headings, lists, etc.).
- [x] Ensure every form input has a `<label>`.
- [x] All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) are keyboard accessible.
- [x] Add `alt` text to all images and icons.
- [x] Avoid using color as the only means of conveying information.

### **Step 2: Pick a Core Flow or Component**
- [x] Choose a high-priority flow (e.g., login, registration, profile update).
- [x] Review and update it for accessibility using the baseline checklist.
- [x] Test with keyboard only (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Esc).
- [x] Run an automated accessibility checker (axe, Lighthouse) and fix critical issues.

### **Step 3: Document and Track Progress**
- [x] Create a simple checklist or table to track which flows/components have been reviewed and fixed.
- [x] Note any issues that require more complex fixes or design changes.

### **Step 4: Repeat for All Major Flows/Components**
- [x] Move to the next most important user flow or component.
- [x] Apply the same review and fix process.

### **Step 5: Advanced Accessibility Enhancements**
- [x] Add ARIA roles and attributes where needed (e.g., dialogs, alerts, navigation landmarks).
- [x] Ensure all error messages are accessible to screen readers.
- [x] Add focus indicators and skip links for improved navigation.
- [x] Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- [x] Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, etc.).

### **Step 6: Automated and Manual Testing**
- [x] Integrate automated accessibility checks (axe, Lighthouse) into your CI/CD pipeline.
- [x] Add regression tests for a11y-critical flows using Testing Library a11y queries.
- [x] Periodically conduct manual audits (keyboard, screen reader, color contrast).

### **Step 7: Documentation and Guidance for Integrators**
- [x] Document your module's accessibility features and limitations.
- [x] Provide guidance for host apps on maintaining accessibility when integrating your module (e.g., theming, focus management).

## Actual User Flows/Components to Review for Accessibility

The following flows and components have been identified in the current codebase as priorities for accessibility review:

1. Registration (Register page and RegistrationForm)
2. Login (Login page and LoginForm)
3. Password Recovery/Reset (ForgotPasswordForm, ResetPasswordForm)
4. Profile Update & Settings (ProfileEditor, ProfileForm, CorporateProfileSection)
5. MFA/2FA Setup (MFAManagementSection, MFAVerificationForm, BackupCodesDisplay)
6. Team/Organization Management (TeamMembersList, RemoveMemberDialog, RoleManagement)
7. Notification Preferences (NotificationPreferencesPanel)
8. Data Export (DataExportPanel, CompanyDataExportPanel)
9. Admin/Audit Log UI (AuditLogPanel)
10. Any additional user-facing flows/components as the app evolves

> This list should be updated as new flows/components are added or identified as critical for accessibility.

## Suggested Order of Flows/Components to Review
1. Login & Registration
2. Password Recovery/Reset
3. Profile Update & Settings
4. MFA/2FA Setup
5. Team/Organization Management
6. Notification Preferences
7. Data Export
8. Admin/Audit Log UI
9. Any additional user-facing flows
