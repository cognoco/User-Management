hase 10: Testing Implementation Plan
Overview
This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Phase 10 of the User Management Module refactoring, which focuses on comprehensive testing of the new architecture. The goal is to ensure all components, from core interfaces to UI elements, are thoroughly tested according to the architectural principles. The current existing  global mocks work well and can be reused

Key Principles
Architecture-Aligned Testing: Tests should be organized according to the layered architecture.
Interface-Based Testing: Test against interfaces, not implementations.
End-User Focus: Prioritize tests that verify complete user flows.
No Implementation Simplification: Never simplify application code just to make tests pass.
Centralized Mocking: Use only global mocks from /src/tests/mocks/. The current existing  global mocks work well and can be moved into the destined location. 

Implementation Tasks


1. Test Organization and Structure
1.1. Create Test Directory Structure

[ ] Create __tests__ directories in each architectural layer:
[ ] /src/core/*/__tests__/ - For core interfaces and entities
[ ] /src/adapters/*/__tests__/ - For adapter implementations
[ ] /src/services/*/__tests__/ - For service implementations
[ ] /src/hooks/*/__tests__/ - For React hooks
[ ] /src/ui/headless/*/__tests__/ - For headless components
[ ] /src/ui/styled/*/__tests__/ - For styled components
1.2. Establish Test Naming Conventions

[ ] Ensure all test files follow kebab-case with .test.ts or .test.tsx extension
[ ] Create naming convention documentation for test files

2. Existing Test Migration

2.1. Inventory Existing Tests

[ ] Create an inventory of all existing tests in the codebase
[ ] Map existing tests to the new architecture components
[ ] Identify tests that can be migrated vs. tests that need to be rewritten

2.2. Migration Process for Each Test File

[ ] Analyze test file to determine if it can be migrated or needs rewriting
[ ] If migrating:
[ ] Update import paths to match new architecture
[ ] Update mock implementations to use centralized mocks

[ ] Fix any broken assertions or setup code
[ ] If rewriting:

Implementation Approach
Progressive Implementation:
Start with core interfaces and work outward to UI components
Prioritize critical functionality (authentication, user management)
Address one domain at a time to ensure comprehensive coverage


Test-Driven Development:
For new tests, follow TDD principles where applicable
Write tests that verify interface contracts first
Then implement tests for specific implementations


Continuous Integration:
Run tests as part of CI pipeline
Enforce coverage thresholds
Prevent merging of code that breaks tests
Success Criteria
All components have corresponding tests in the appropriate __tests__ directory
Test coverage meets or exceeds established thresholds
All tests pass consistently (no flaky tests)
Tests verify both happy paths and edge cases
Mocking strategy is consistent and well-documented
Test utilities are reusable and well-documented
Risks and Mitigations
Risk: Existing tests may be tightly coupled to old architecture Mitigation: Be prepared to rewrite tests completely rather than forcing migration
Risk: Mocking complex APIs like Supabase can be challenging Mitigation: The existing mocks work fine and shall be reused. Develop robust, reusable mock templates and document patterns
Risk: Test maintenance can become burdensome Mitigation: Focus on testing interfaces rather than implementations to reduce maintenance
Risk: Tests may become flaky due to async operations Mitigation: Follow best practices for testing async code, use proper act() and waitFor() wrappers
