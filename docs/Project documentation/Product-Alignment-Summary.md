## Product Alignment Summary (H1-MVP â†’ Current Implementation)

Source docs

- 02-PRD.md (authoritative scope tags: [Scope: H1-MVP], [H1-Core], [H2-Enterprise])

### H1-MVP features and status snapshot

- Authentication (register, login, logout, session validation, email verification, reset/update password)
  - Backend: implemented under `app/api/auth/**` with handlers and middleware; aligns with PRD endpoints and acceptance criteria.
  - Gaps: confirm rate-limit middleware on resend verification/reset endpoints; ensure lockout after 5 failed attempts is enforced.

- Profile management (get/update profile, avatar upload)
  - Backend: routes present under `app/api/profile/**` with upload endpoints and validations.
  - Gaps: double-validate image content sniffing and size limits per PRD; verify visibility/consent toggles exist or stub.

- Account deletion
  - Backend: endpoint exists; verify flow requires password/confirmation and retention policy application per PRD.

- Account security (change password, change email with verify-new-email)
  - Backend: change password route present; change-email/verify-new-email flow needs verification against PRD token flows and notifications.

- Billing (Stripe): checkout session, portal session, webhook, subscription status
  - Backend: present under `app/api/subscriptions/**` and `app/api/webhooks/stripe`.
  - Gaps: re-check idempotency, signature validation, and local subscription sync logic per PRD.

### Architecture compliance (non-negotiable)

- Interface-first services and adapters
  - Present conceptually (services, adapters); audit needed to ensure service contracts are provider-agnostic and have mock implementations per PRD quality gate.

- Headless UI with vendor-secure elements
  - UI layered (headless/styled). Confirm sensitive payment inputs rely on vendor components when embedded.

- Configuration-driven providers
  - ENV-driven selection partially present; consolidate into a single service container for auth, payments.

### Client/server boundary hardening

- Status: audit logger fixed; webpack aliases block realtime on client; remaining work tracked in Client-Server-Boundary-Checklist.

### Immediate actions (next)

1) Implement Phase 1 (config boundary split) tasks
2) Consolidate Supabase server entry (Phase 2)
3) Migrate remaining UI Supabase usages to API (Phase 3)
4) Add ESLint guardrails (Phase 4)

This document will be updated as each phase completes.
