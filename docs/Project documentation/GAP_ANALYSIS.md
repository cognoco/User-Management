# GAP ANALYSIS

## Overview
This document serves as the single source of truth for all gaps, missing features, and open issues in the User Management System. It provides a structured analysis of what needs to be implemented, organized by category and priority.

## Development & Testing Approach
- The project uses a production-first, test-second approach for all new features
- Tests are written after production code is complete, unless a feature is high-risk
- This ensures tests always reflect the real, user-facing implementation
