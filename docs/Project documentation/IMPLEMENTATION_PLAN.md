Integration Features (Webhooks, API Key Management) - Status & Requirements

Webhooks Implementation:
No actual webhook implementation found in the codebase
No dedicated API routes for webhook management (/api/webhooks or similar)
Mentioned in documentation as a planned feature but not yet implemented
No dedicated test files for webhook functionality

For Webhooks:
Implement integration tests to verify webhook creation, delivery, and error handling
Test webhook event filtering (ensuring only selected events trigger webhooks)
Test webhook payload format and delivery reliability
Test webhook security (signature verification, rate limiting)
Test webhook error handling (retry logic, failure logging)

API Key Management:
No API key management implementation found
No UI components for creating, viewing, or revoking API keys
No API routes for API key operations
Marked as "Not implemented" in Gap Analysis and Flow Verification documents

For API Key Management:
Test API key creation, viewing, and revocation flows
Test API key permission scoping
Test API key usage for authentication
Test API key security features (expiration, rotation)
Test API key audit logging

Stripe Webhooks:
Some references to Stripe webhook handling in documentation, but no clear implementation
No specific tests for Stripe webhook callbacks
Test Implementation Requirements:
To properly test these integrations, we would need to:

Testing Strategy:
Create integration tests that mock external services but test real webhook/API key logic
Create E2E tests for the UI flows (key management, webhook configuration)
Implement specific tests for security aspects (key revocation, webhook signature verification)
